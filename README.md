## 👋 About Me

I'm an **IT Professional transitioning into GRC and Cybersecurity Analysis**. I’m driven by the challenge of securing digital environments while ensuring organizations remain aligned with regulatory and industry standards. 
I thrive on solving complex problems, analyzing risk, and creating structure through **hands-on, real-world projects** that strengthen both security posture and compliance maturity, and that make a tangible impact.

🔐 Along my journey, I've worked on:

- **Vulnerability Management** – identifying, prioritizing, and addressing security weaknesses.
- **Threat Detection & Analysis** – investigating suspicious activity and improving defensive strategies.
- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** – implementing frameworks and controls to ensure regulatory alignment and reduce risk.

These experiences have deepened my understanding of real-world cyber threats, compliance obligations, and how to mitigate risks effectively.


🚀 I invite you to explore my projects and see how I've contributed to strengthening security operations, enhancing compliance processes, and building a more resilient IT landscape.
